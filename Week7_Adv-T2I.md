# Unit 5: GAI Workshop â€“ Application and Practice of Image DesignðŸš€

## Lab 26: Precision Prompting & Image Recreation ðŸ¤”

Practice prompt refinement by replicating a reference image through multiple iterations. **Assignment**: Observe a sample AI image, draft a detailed prompt, refine it through at least three iterations, and analyze differences.

### Original image generated by AI: Accurate prompts need to be designed to "copy" these images and analyze errors and possible optimization directions.
