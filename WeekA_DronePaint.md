### **Q1. When we wave to control drones in DronePaint, what kind of information is the system "seeing" and transforming into motion? Describe the mechanism of gesture recognition in your own words.**

Answer: When I wave, the system extracts key finger joint positions and calculates shapes and motions, feeding them into a trained model that matches my gesture to a command like "take off" or "draw path."

### **Q2. List at least 3 technical components of DronePaint (e.g., DNN, image detection module) and explain what would happen if each were missing.**

Answer: Critical Components of DronePaints in

1. Gesture Recognition (DNN + Mediapipe) → Missing? No input; drone cannot receive human intent.

2. Trajectory Smoothing (α–β filter) → Missing? Jerky drone paths, unsafe or unartistic.

3. Swarm Control Algorithm (Potential Field) → Missing? Drones may crash or fail to follow complex paths.

Insight: Each component acts like an organ in a living system—missing one breaks the whole flow.

### **Q3. If DronePaint were scaled for a large outdoor performance, what technical upgrades or safety improvements would be necessary?**
Answer: Scaling for Outdoor Use and some upgrades are Needed:

1. Switch from Vicon to GPS or RTK-GPS for positioning

2. Add safety geofencing and obstacle detection (Lidar)

3. Waterproof casing and wind compensation for stability

Insight: Transitioning from lab to outdoor event is like moving from a fish tank to the ocean—you need new tools to navigate safely.

### **Q4. Compared to keyboard/mouse or touch control, what are the advantages of gesture control? Are there clear limitations or scenarios where it shines?**
Answer: Gesture vs Keyboard/Touch

Pros: Intuitive and natural, Hands-free, useful in large spaces or when physically active

Cons: Less precise than mouse, Sensitive to lighting and body fatigue

Best Fit: Art installations, therapy, education demos—not detailed editing tasks.

Insight: Gesture control is a “body language” interface—great for flow, weak for precision.

### **Q5. As an art creator, how would you use DronePaint’s light painting effects to express a specific social issue? Propose a theme and visual concept.**

Answer: Art for Social Impact, DronePaint can transform intangible emotion into living light—it’s a paintbrush for social empathy.

### Q6. From a business innovation perspective, how can DronePaint be commercialized into a product or service? Propose a business model (e.g., B2B, B2C, subscription) and explain why it fits.

Answer: B2B SaaS + Event Leasing Model, and sell licenses to schools/museums, and offer event setup packages with trained staff.

### Q7. Imagine DronePaint integrated into a museum or public event. How would you design an experiential marketing campaign (體驗式行銷／体験型マーケティング) using it?

Answer:  Experiential Marketing Campaign in Pop-up drone art booths at festivals, Users draw with hand gestures → drone paints it live, Share instant video on social media

### Q8. Compare gesture recognition (手勢辨識／ジェスチャー認識) with voice recognition (語音辨識／音声認識) in the context of immersive interaction. What are their pros, cons, and best-fit use cases?

Answer: Gesture recognition and voice recognition are both pivotal modalities in human-computer interaction, each suited for distinct contexts. Gesture recognition excels in applications requiring spatial awareness, such as drone control, gaming, and interactive art installations. It enables intuitive, silent input and is ideal in noisy environments or where verbal commands may be disruptive. However, it heavily relies on consistent lighting and clear visibility of hand or body movements, making it vulnerable in low-light or cluttered settings.

In contrast, voice recognition thrives in environments where rapid, hands-free control is essential, such as smart home systems and virtual assistants. Its key strength lies in its speed and accessibility—users can issue commands without visual or physical engagement. Nevertheless, voice systems are susceptible to background noise, accents, and language barriers, which can reduce reliability in public or multilingual settings. Ultimately, gesture recognition is spatially expressive, while voice recognition is audibly efficient. Selecting between them should depend on environmental factors and the nature of the interaction task.

### Q9. If DronePaint were used in sports events or concerts, what AI enhancements would you add (e.g., predictive choreography, audience reaction analysis)? Visualize your ideas using storyboards or sketches by GAI.

Answer: Live events like sports games or concerts involve large audiences, dynamic energy, and demand real-time adaptability. DronePaint, when enhanced with AI, can transform from a static light painting tool into a reactive, emotionally engaging performance system.

AI Application Areas:

Predictive Choreography – AI analyzes real-time audio features (e.g., BPM, genre changes, climaxes) to pre-plan or auto-adjust drone flight paths and effects.

Audience Reaction Analysis – Computer vision systems scan audience faces/body language to estimate engagement (e.g., cheering, clapping, smiling) and reflect it through live drone visuals (color, speed, formation).

Personalized Immersion – Using smartphone feedback (via event apps), audience preferences can influence the drone color palette or formations during certain segments.

### Q10. Explore the risks of DNN misinterpretation in gesture recognition. What system redundancies or error-handling protocols would you design to minimize false positives in public spaces?

Answer: Risks of DNN Misinterpretation and Safety Design for Public Use: Deep neural networks in DronePaint interpret human gestures by classifying patterns in hand movement data. However, in public or crowded spaces, these models can misinterpret random or unrelated hand motions (like waving, stretching, or clapping) as valid control commands. This is called a false positive, and it can lead to unexpected drone behavior such as sudden takeoff or trajectory shifts. In high-traffic environments, such misinterpretations could endanger nearby people or damage property.
Designing AI systems responsibly means thinking not only about what they can do but also what they might mistakenly do. By adding layers of checks and context awareness, we make gesture recognition safer and smarter, especially in unpredictable real-world settings.
