# What Is GAI?

## 💻Mission 1 - What Is GAI?📌 🔬 Understanding Generative AI & Its Applications

### **📌 Answers for Horace – Analyzing Generative AI (GAI) and Its Applications**

---

### **✅ Q1: What is the main difference between Generative AI (GAI, 生成式人工智慧) and Traditional AI (傳統人工智慧)?**  

🔹 **Traditional AI (傳統人工智慧)** focuses on **analyzing data (數據分析), making predictions (預測), and automating decision-making (決策自動化)**. It is widely used for **classification (分類), recommendation systems (推薦系統), fraud detection (詐欺偵測), and process automation (流程自動化)**.  

🔹 **Generative AI (GAI, 生成式人工智慧)** is designed **not just to analyze but to create (生成內容)**. It can produce **new text (ChatGPT), images (DALL·E, MidJourney), videos (Runway AI), music (Suno AI), and even code (Copilot, Code Llama)**. Unlike traditional AI, which **identifies patterns and follows rules**, GAI can **generate original outputs, mimic creativity, and enhance problem-solving in innovative ways**.  

📌 **Key Differences:**
| **Aspect** | **Traditional AI (傳統AI)** | **Generative AI (GAI)** |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Main Function** | Data analysis, prediction, automation | Content creation, creativity, and augmentation |
| **Example Applications** | Fraud detection, self-driving cars, speech recognition | AI-generated text, images, music, video, and code |
| **User Interaction** | Provides recommendations and decisions | Engages interactively and generates original content |
| **Processing Style** | Works with structured data (rules, numbers) | Works with unstructured data (language, images, audio) |
| **Example Technologies** | Google Search, Siri, Financial Forecasting AI | ChatGPT, MidJourney, Runway AI, Copilot |
